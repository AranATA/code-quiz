## description

***
 This is an application to run a timed quiz on coding that has five multiple-choice questions. The app has the ability to<br>
 process the user input via mouse or keyboard in the browser window and determine the outcome. The last step includes<br>
 the storage and call back of the highest results. It is featuring a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript<br>
 code - all without any initial coding. This work focuses on utilizing an array of API's like local storage and event listeners.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:<br>
* WHEN I click the start button; THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
* WHEN I answer a question; THEN I am presented with another question<br>
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly; THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0; THEN the game is over<br>
* WHEN the game is over; THEN I can save my initials and my score<br>
