## description

***
 This is an application to run a timed quiz on coding that has five multiple-choice questions. The app has the ability to
 process the user input via mouse or keyboard in the browser window and determine the outcome. The last step includes
 the storage and call back of the highest results. It is featuring a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript
 code - all without any initial coding. This work focuses on utilizing an array of API's like local storage and event listeners.<br>
The coding is organized over multiple HTML, CSS and JS files. Such an organization provided a better control over the whole and the parts.  
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:<br>
* WHEN I click the start button; THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
* WHEN I answer a question; THEN I am presented with another question<br>
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly; THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0; THEN the game is over<br>
* WHEN the game is over; THEN I can save my initials and my score<br>
